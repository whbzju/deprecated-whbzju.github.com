在我的认知中，编程最需要要关心的是数据结构和消息机制。进一步，即模块功能的定义，以及模块之间的通信。这和编程中的回调机制十分类似。回调在wiki中有如下定义：
> In computer programming, a callback is a piece of executable code that is passed as an argument to other code, which is expected to call back (execute) the argument at some convenient time. The invocation may be immediate as in a synchronous callback or it might happen at later time, as in an asynchronous callback.
The ways that callbacks are supported in programming languages differ, but they are often implemented with subroutines, lambda expressions, blocks, or function pointers.
